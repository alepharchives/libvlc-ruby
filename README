Ruby-vlc, ruby vlc extension made by Diego Luca Candido

Ruby-vlc is a ruby extension for libvlc written using swig and it's implemented with c++.
The extension works on linux and with cygwin on windows.
The rdoc-generator.rb holds wrapper classes to document in rdoc.

To compile the extension you need libvlc-dev and libsdl-dev, to compile sources you have to invoke rake.
